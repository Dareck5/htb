Post-log-in, the web application will set the user a special permission in the form of a

SQL Injection is a common way of exploiting web pages that use SQL Statements that retrieve and store
user input data. If configured incorrectly, one can use this attack to exploit the well-known SQL Injection
vulnerability. 
There are many different techniques of protecting from SQL injections, some of them being input validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, and
implementing a WAF (Web Application Firewall) on the perimeter of the server's network.
