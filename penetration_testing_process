Information Gathering 	Next, we move towards the Information Gathering stage. 
                        Before any target systems can be examined and attacked, we must first identify them. 
                        It may well be that the customer will not give us any information about their network and components other than a domain name or just a listing of in-scope IP addresses/network ranges.
