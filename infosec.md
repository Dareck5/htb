### Setting Up a Pentest Distro

A <b>hypervisor</b> is software that allows us to create and run virtual machines (VMs). 
It will enable us to use our host computer to run multiple VMs by virtually sharing memory and processing resources.
VMs on a hypervisor run isolated from the primary operating system, which offers a layer of isolation and protection between our production network 
and vulnerable networks, such as Hack The Box, or when connecting to client environments from a VM (though VM breakout vulnerabilities do arise from time to time).<br>

It is often helpful to stand up a VM during an assessment to test out an exploit or attempt to recreate a target application and stand-up machines in a lab environment to test out the latest tools, exploits, and techniques.
