Here we have a folder for the client Acme Company with two assessments, <b>Internal Penetration Test (IPT)</b> and <b>External Penetration Test (EPT)</b>. Under each folder, we have subfolders for saving scan data, any relevant tools, logging output, scoping information (i.e., lists of IPs/networks to feed to our scanning tools), and an evidence folder that may contain any credentials retrieved during the assessment, any relevant data retrieved as well as screenshots.
