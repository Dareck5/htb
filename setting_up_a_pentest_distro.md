# Setting Up a Pentest Distro

<br>

VMs on a hypervisor run isolated from the primary operating system, which offers a layer of isolation and protection between our production network and vulnerable networks, such as Hack The Box, or when connecting to client environments from a VM (though VM breakout vulnerabilities do arise from time to time).

## Folder Structure

<br>

<br>

Here we have a folder for the client Acme Company with two assessments, **Internal Penetration Test (IPT)** and **External Penetration Test (EPT)**. Under each folder, we have subfolders for saving scan data, any relevant tools, logging output, scoping information (i.e., lists of IPs/networks to feed to our scanning tools), and an evidence folder that may contain any credentials retrieved during the assessment, any relevant data retrieved as well as screenshots.

## VPN Issues

<br>

### Connecting to HTB VPN

```bash
sudo openvpn {filename}.ovpn
```

### Still Connected to VPN

The easiest method of checking if we have successfully connected to the VPN network is by checking whether we have `Initialization Sequence Completed` at the end of our VPN connection messages:
```
Dareck7@htb[/htb]$ sudo openvpn ./htb.ovpn

...SNIP...

Initialization Sequence Completed
```

### Getting VPN Address

Another way of checking whether we are connected to the VPN network is by checking our VPN `tun0` address, which we can find with the following command:
<br>
```
Dareck7@htb[/htb]$ ip -4 a show tun0

6: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    inet 10.10.10.1/23 scope global tun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
 ```
 As long we get our IP back, then we should be connected to the VPN network.
 
 ### Checking Routing Table

Another way to check for connectivity is to use the command sudo `netstat -rn` to view our routing table:
```
Dareck7@htb[/htb]$ sudo netstat -rn

[sudo] password for user: 

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.195.2   0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.10.14.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 tun0
10.129.0.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.0.0     UG        0 0          0 tun0
192.168.1.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
```

### Pinging Gateway

From here, we can see that we are connected to the `10.10.14.0/23` network on the `tun0` adapter and have access to the `10.129.0.0/16` network and can ping the gateway `10.10.14.1` to confirm access.
```
Dareck7@htb[/htb]$ ping -c 4 10.10.14.1
PING 10.10.14.1 (10.10.14.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 110.574/110.793/111.056/0.174 ms
```
Finally, we can either attack an assigned target host on the 10.129.0.0/16 network or begin enumeration for live hosts.
