#### Pre-Engagement
```
The pre-engagement stage is where the main commitments, tasks, scope, limitations, and related agreements are documented in writing. 
During this stage, contractual documents are drawn up, and essential information is exchanged 
that is relevant for penetration testers and the client, depending on the type of assessment.
```

#### Information Gathering
```
Next, we move towards the Information Gathering stage. 
Before any target systems can be examined and attacked, we must first identify them. 
It may well be that the customer will not give us any information about their network and components other than a domain name or just a listing of in-scope IP addresses/network ranges. 
Therefore, we need to get an overview of the target web application(s) or network before proceeding further.
```

#### Vulnerability Assessment 	
``` diff
The next stop on our journey is Vulnerability Assessment, where we use the information found to identify potential weaknesses. 
We can use vulnerability scanners that will scan the target systems for known vulnerabilities and manual analysis 
+ (an analysis is more about thinking outside the box) 
where we try to look behind the scenes to discover where the potential vulnerabilities might lie.
